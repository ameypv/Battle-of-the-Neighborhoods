# Battle-of-the-Neighborhoods
This capstone project is a part of the Coursera's IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course, and is a peer-graded assignment. It leverages the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice, or to come up with a problem that uses the Foursquare location data as a part of its solution.
